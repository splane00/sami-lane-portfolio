**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-lane-917771155/  

Bioinformatics graduate student with a focus on epigenetics and functional genomics, and a strong interest in women’s health and reproductive technology. Experienced in Python- and R-based data analysis, transcriptomics, promoter and regulatory element analysis, and interpretation of public functional genomics datasets (GTEx, GEO, ENCODE). Passionate about building clear, reproducible analyses that integrate computational rigor with biological insight.

This portfolio highlights selected projects demonstrating reproducible workflow design, statistical analysis, and cross-language integration using Python, R/Bioconductor, and modern bioinformatics tools.

**Programming & Analysis**  
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib); R (Bioconductor, DESeq2, tidyverse); Jupyter Notebook  

**Bioinformatics & Genomics**  
RNA-seq analysis (count-based modeling, normalization, exploratory QC); Differential expression analysis; Transcriptomics and functional genomics; Familiarity with ChIP-seq and proteomics data analysis; Public datasets (GEO, GTEx, ENCODE); Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis; Multi-omics analysis using public bioinformatics tools (NCBI, Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser; BLAST/FASTA; InterPro, TMHMM, SignalP)
  
**Reproducibility & Engineering**  
Docker; Bash scripting; Git/GitHub; Linux/macOS environments; Reproducible workflows and dependency management
  
## Featured Projects

### [Differential Expression Mini-Analysis (Simulated RNA-seq)](https://github.com/splane00/rna-seq-mini)
This pipeline simulates RNA-seq count data in Python using a negative binomial model, then applies DESeq2 in R for normalization, differential expression analysis, and exploratory visualization (PCA and volcano plots). The project emphasizes reproducibility, statistical modeling, and clean Python–R integration without external data dependencies.  

**Example outputs:**  
PCA and Volcano plots generated from simulated RNA-seq data.

- Predicted promoter architecture, transcription factor motifs, and regulatory elements
- Modeled protein domains, Ig-like structures, signal peptide, and transmembrane topology
- Evaluated expression across tissues (GTEx) and in breast cancer (GEO GSE15852)
- Integrated ENCODE histone marks and DNase-seq to assess regulatory activity
- Performed multi-species conservation analysis using BLAST, FASTA, and MSAs

**Skills:** Genomic annotation, promoter analysis, protein structure prediction (InterPro, TMHMM, SignalP, PSIPRED), BLAST/FASTA, GTEx/GEO/ENCODE interpretation, UCSC Genome Browser, scientific writing
