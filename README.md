# Samantha Lane - Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Samantha Lane, an M.S. Bioinformatics student at Johns Hopkins University specializing in transcriptomics, epigenetic regulation, and multi-omics analysis. My work focuses on using computational genomics to understand regulatory mechanisms, especially in women’s health, cancer, and reproductive biology.  
  
This portfolio showcases my pipeline development, genomic data analysis, and computational biology projects. Each project reflects professional, reproducible bioinformatics practices and is built using Python, R, and modern sequencing tools.

### BTN1A1 Multi-Omics Epigenetic Regulatory Analysis  
My ongoing research project: an integrative analysis of DNA methylation, histone marks, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-seq to investigate epigenetic silencing of BTN1A1 in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.  

Highlights:
- Integrated ENCODE + GEO datasets
- Identified candidate repressor regions
- Visualized promoter accessibility and epigenetic state
- Explored regulatory mechanisms across cell types  

Skills: ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, RNA-seq, matplotlib, seaborn, promoter analysis
Repo: btn1a1-mini
