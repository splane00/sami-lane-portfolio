- Predicted promoter architecture, transcription factor motifs, and regulatory elements
- Modeled protein domains, Ig-like structures, signal peptide, and transmembrane topology
- Evaluated expression across tissues (GTEx) and in breast cancer (GEO GSE15852)
- Integrated ENCODE histone marks and DNase-seq to assess regulatory activity
- Performed multi-species conservation analysis using BLAST, FASTA, and MSAs

Skills: Genomic annotation, promoter analysis, protein structure prediction (InterPro, TMHMM, SignalP, PSIPRED), BLAST/FASTA, GTEx/GEO/ENCODE interpretation, UCSC Genome Browser, multi-alignment tools, scientific writing
