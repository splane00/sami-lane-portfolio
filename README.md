# Samantha (Sami) Lane – Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Master's student in **Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University (AAP)** with interests in **genomics, women’s health, and computational biology**. This repository highlights selected projects that showcase my skills in **Python, data analysis, bioinformatics pipelines, and software development**.

## Projects

### Bioinformatics
- [**BTN1A1 Gene Analysis**](https://github.com/splane00/bioinfo_projects/blob/main/BTN1A1-analysis.md)
  Explored gene structure, SNPs, and protein domains using Ensembl, NCBI, and UCSC Genome Browser.  
  *Skills:* Genomic databases, sequence analysis, literature integration.  

- **Diabetes Risk Prediction**  
  Machine learning model to predict diabetes risk from clinical data.  
  *Skills:* Pandas, Scikit-learn, logistic regression, data visualization.  

- **Transcriptomics Pipeline (in progress)**  
  Python-based workflow for RNA-seq data preprocessing and analysis.  
  *Skills:* Biopython, Pandas, pipeline automation.  

### Software Development  
- [**Huffman Encoding Tree Implementation**](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-3) - Data Structures coursework  
  Java implementation of a Huffman tree for text compression and decompression. The program builds an encoding tree from character frequencies, generates binary codes, and encodes/decodes files while reporting compression results.  
  *Skills:* Java, binary trees, greedy algorithms, file I/O, modular design.
- [**Quicksort vs. Natural Merge Sort**](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-4) - Data Structures coursework  
  Java project comparing the performance of Quicksort and Natural Merge Sort on different input datasets. The program measures runtime and analyzes efficiency based on input size and order.  
  *Skills:* Java, sorting algorithms, algorithm analysis, runtime measurement, data structures.  
- **Dance Studio App** - coming soon!  
  Full-stack web application to manage classes, schedules, costumes, and ticketing for a dance school.    
  *Skills:* React, Next.js, Firebase, database design.

### Undergraduate Projects
- **Literature Review:** ["Ethical Implications of Clinician Responses to Patients Presenting with Suicidal Ideation"](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/BHUM%20Lit%20Review.pdf)
- **Literature Review:** "Feasibility of Using Pharmacogenomics as Standard Practice in Psychiatric Healthcare" - coming soon!
- **Organic Chemistry Research:** [“Optimization of Alkylation of Ammonia and Amines Reaction to Selectively Form Ammonium Salts”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/Optimization%20of%20Alkylation%20OCII.pdf)
- **Organic Chemistry Research:** [“Optimization of Alcohol Reagent in Williamson Ether Synthesis”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/Williamson%20Ether%20Synthesis%20OCII.pdf)
