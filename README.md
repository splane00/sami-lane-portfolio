# Samantha Lane - Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Samantha Lane, an M.S. Bioinformatics student at Johns Hopkins University specializing in transcriptomics, epigenetic regulation, and multi-omics analysis. My work focuses on using computational genomics to understand regulatory mechanisms, especially in women’s health, cancer, and reproductive biology.  
  
This portfolio showcases my pipeline development, genomic data analysis, and computational biology projects. Each project reflects professional, reproducible bioinformatics practices and is built using Python, R, and modern sequencing tools.

### [BTN1A1 Multi-Omics Characterization](https://github.com/splane00/bioinfo_projects/blob/main/BTN1A1.pdf)  
A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of BTN1A1 integrating genomics, transcriptomics, protein structure prediction, evolutionary conservation, and regulatory landscape annotation. This project synthesizes public datasets and computational tools to generate a research-grade multi-omics gene profile.

Highlights:
- Annotated BTN1A1 gene structure, isoforms, SNPs, paralogs, and orthologs
- Predicted promoter architecture, transcription factor motifs, and regulatory elements
- Modeled protein domains, Ig-like structures, signal peptide, and transmembrane topology
- Evaluated expression across tissues (GTEx) and in breast cancer (GEO GSE15852)
- Integrated ENCODE histone marks and DNase-seq to assess regulatory activity
- Performed multi-species conservation analysis using BLAST, FASTA, and MSAs

Skills: Genomic annotation, promoter analysis, protein structure prediction (InterPro, TMHMM, SignalP, PSIPRED), BLAST/FASTA, GTEx/GEO/ENCODE interpretation, UCSC Genome Browser, multi-alignment tools, scientific writing
