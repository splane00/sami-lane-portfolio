# Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights projects and skills from my graduate coursework in **molecular biology, epigenetics, and bioinformatics** at Johns Hopkins University.  
Each section links to a dedicated repository that demonstrates a core skill area.

## Core Skills

- [**Database Navigation**](https://github.com/splane00/database-navigation)  
  Working with NCBI Gene, Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser, and PubMed searches.

- [**Sequence Alignment**](https://github.com/splane00/sequence-alignment)  
  BLAST, pairwise alignments, and multiple sequence alignments (Clustal, MUSCLE).

- [**Phylogenetics**](https://github.com/splane00/phylogenetics)  
  Building and interpreting phylogenetic trees using MEGA, PhyML, and Ensembl Trees.

- [**Protein & Gene Analysis**](https://github.com/splane00/protein-gene-analysis)  
  Protein motifs, domains, and structure prediction with UniProt and Pfam.

- [**Expression Data Analysis**](https://github.com/splane00/expression-data-analysis)  
  Exploring GEO datasets, RNA-seq, microarrays, and genetic variation data.

- [**Scientific Communication**](https://github.com/splane00/scientific-communication)  
  Research summaries, critiques, and polished projects.

- [**R/Python for Bioinformatics**](https://github.com/splane00/r-python-bioinformatics)  
  Scripts, notebooks, and utilities for sequence, expression, and visualization tasks.
