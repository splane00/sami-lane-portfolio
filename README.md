# Portfolio
Hi, I’m Samantha (Sami) Lane — Bioinformatics M.S. student at Johns Hopkins (2025–2027). I specialize in genomics, data analysis, and computational biology.
This portfolio highlights projects and skills from my graduate coursework. Each section links to a dedicated repository that demonstrates a core skill area. It is designed to demonstrate practical skills, reproducible workflows, and clear scientific communication for research and industry roles in genomics, epigenetics, and precision medicine.

## Projects

- [**Bioinformatics projects**](https://github.com/splane00/bioinfo_projects)  
  Working with NCBI Gene, Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser, PubMed searches, BLAST, pairwise alignments, and multiple sequence alignments.

  - [Analysis of BTN1A1 Gene](https://github.com/splane00/bioinfo_projects/blob/main/BTN1A1-analysis.md) (ongoing)  
    Conducted database-driven analysis of the BTN1A1 gene using Entrez, Ensembl, NCBI, BLAST, and ENCODE.  
    Identified splice variants, SNPs, and orthologs across multiple species.  
    Compared protein domains and regulatory regions to assess potential impacts on gene expression and function.  
    Produced a structured report with database screenshots, sequence alignments, and visualizations.

- **Coding Projects**
  - [Data Structures: Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-4)  
    Evaluated Quicksort variants and Natural Merge Sort on datasets up to 10,000 elements, benchmarking comparisons and exchanges.
  - [Data Structures: Huffman Encoding Tree project](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-3)  
    Implemented a tree-based text compression algorithm in Python, enabling efficient encoding and decoding of input files.
  - [Data Structures: Recursion project](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-1)
    Developed recursive solutions in Python (factorial, Fibonacci, and tree traversal) to strengthen algorithmic problem-solving.
  - [Data Structures: Prefix to postfix conversion](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-2)
    Built a stack-based program to convert mathematical expressions, demonstrating algorithm design and error checking.
  - Dance Recital Scheduler - coming soon!  
    Created a scheduling tool to reduce family conflicts and optimize seating for 450+ attendees per show.

    
- [**Undergraduate Projects**](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad)  
  - [Literature Review: “Feasibility of Using Pharmacogenomics as Standard Practice in Psychiatric Healthcare”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/Pharmacogenomics%20final%20draft.pdf)  
  - [Literature Review: “The Ethical Implications of Clinical Responses to Patients Presenting with Suicidal Ideation”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/BHUM%20Lit%20Review.pdf)  
  - [Organic Chemistry II Research Lab: "Determination of the Results of Halogenation of Vanillin Using Bleach and NaBr with EtOAc as the Solvent”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/Optimization%20of%20Alkylation%20OCII.pdf)  
  - [Organic Chemistry II Research Lab: “Optimization of Alcohol Reagent in Williamson Ether Synthesis”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/Williamson%20Ether%20Synthesis%20OCII.pdf)  

- **Data Analysis & Visualization** - coming soon!
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and Pandas** - Coursera Project Network  
    Performed data wrangling, cleaning, and transformation on tabular datasets.  
    Applied EDA techniques to uncover trends and generate summary statistics.  
    Built data visualizations in Seaborn and Matplotlib, turning raw data into clear insights.  

  - **Data Cleaning in Excel** - Coursera Project Network  
    Standardized and organized a messy dataset using Excel formulas and automation techniques.  
    Eliminated duplicates, corrected formatting errors, and validated entries.  
    Produced a clean dataset suitable for downstream analysis and reporting.
