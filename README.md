# Samantha (Sami) Lane – Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Master's student in **Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University** with interests in **genomics, women’s health, and computational biology**. This repository highlights selected projects that showcase my skills in **Python, data analysis, bioinformatics pipelines, and software development**.

## Projects

### Bioinformatics
- [**BTN1A1 Gene Analysis**](https://github.com/splane00/bioinfo_projects/blob/main/BTN1A1-analysis.md) - in progress
  Explored gene structure, SNPs, and protein domains using Ensembl, NCBI, and UCSC Genome Browser.  
  *Skills:* Genomic databases, sequence analysis, literature integration.

### Software Development  
- [**Huffman Encoding Tree Implementation**](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-3) - Data Structures coursework  
  Python implementation of a Huffman tree for text compression and decompression. The program builds an encoding tree from character frequencies, generates binary codes, and encodes/decodes files while reporting compression results.  
  *Skills:* Python, binary trees, greedy algorithms, file I/O, modular design.
- [**Quicksort vs. Natural Merge Sort**](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-4) - Data Structures coursework  
  Python project comparing the performance of Quicksort and Natural Merge Sort on different input datasets. The program measures runtime and analyzes efficiency based on input size and order.  
  *Skills:* Python, sorting algorithms, algorithm analysis, runtime measurement, data structures.
- [**Prefix to Postfix Converter**](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-1) - Data Structures coursework  
  Python program that converts prefix expressions to postfix form using a stack-based approach. Demonstrates parsing, validation, and expression conversion with proper error handling.  
  *Skills:* Python, stacks, expression parsing, algorithm design, modular programming.  
- [**Stack Implementation**](https://github.com/splane00/data-struc-2) - Data Structures coursework    
  Python program implementing a stack data structure with operations for push, pop, peek, and error handling. Includes file input/output to test stack functionality with expression evaluation.  
*Skills:* Python, stacks, data structures, file I/O, modular programming.  
- **Dance Studio App** - coming soon!  
  Full-stack web application to manage classes, schedules, costumes, and ticketing for a dance school.    
  *Skills:* Python, Javascript (React, Next.js), Firebase, HTML, CSS, database design.  

### Data Analysis and Visualization  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas** - Coursera Project Network - coming soon!  
  *Skills:* Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matploptlib, data wrangling, data cleaning, tabular datasets, statistical analysis
- **Data Cleaning in Excel: Techniques to Clean Messy Data** - Coursera Project Network - coming soon!  
  *Skills:* Microsoft Excel, Excel formulas, automation techniques, data cleaning  

### Undergraduate Projects
- **Literature Review:** ["Ethical Implications of Clinician Responses to Patients Presenting with Suicidal Ideation"](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/BHUM%20Lit%20Review.pdf)
- **Literature Review:** "Feasibility of Using Pharmacogenomics as Standard Practice in Psychiatric Healthcare" - coming soon!
- **Organic Chemistry Research:** [“Optimization of Alkylation of Ammonia and Amines Reaction to Selectively Form Ammonium Salts”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/Optimization%20of%20Alkylation%20OCII.pdf)
- **Organic Chemistry Research:** [“Optimization of Alcohol Reagent in Williamson Ether Synthesis”](https://github.com/splane00/undergrad/blob/main/Williamson%20Ether%20Synthesis%20OCII.pdf)
