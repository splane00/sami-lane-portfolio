# Samantha Lane 
# Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Samantha (Sami) Lane, an M.S. Bioinformatics student at Johns Hopkins University specializing in transcriptomics, gene regulation, and multi-omics analysis.
My work focuses on using computational genomics to understand regulatory mechanisms in women’s health, cancer, and reproductive biology.

This portfolio showcases my pipeline development, genomic data analysis, and computational biology projects.
Each project reflects professional, reproducible bioinformatics practices and is built using Python, R, and modern sequencing tools.

🔬 Featured Projects
🧪 RNA-seq Differential Expression Pipeline (in progress)

A fully reproducible RNA-seq analysis workflow built from scratch.

Includes:

FASTQ QC (fastp), trimming, MultiQC

Salmon indexing + quantification

DESeq2 differential expression

QC plots, PCA, clustering

Modular file structure (src/, results/, env/)

Skills: command-line tools, workflow design, reproducibility, Python + R, Git
➡️ Repo: rna-seq-pipeline

🧬 BTN1A1 Multi-Omics Regulatory Analysis

My ongoing research project: an integrative analysis of DNA methylation, histone marks, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-seq to investigate epigenetic silencing of BTN1A1 in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells.

Highlights:

Integrated ENCODE + GEO datasets

Identified candidate repressor regions

Visualized promoter accessibility and epigenetic state

Explored regulatory mechanisms across cell types

Skills: ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, RNA-seq, matplotlib, seaborn, promoter analysis
➡️ Repo: btn1a1-mini (if this is the correct repo; update link as needed)

💻 Data Structures & Algorithms – Bioinformatics Implementations

A collection of computer science projects demonstrating algorithmic thinking and clean coding practices.

Examples include:

Huffman encoding and decoding

Sorting algorithms (quicksort, natural merge sort)

File I/O utilities, stack/queue implementations

These projects emphasize code clarity, modularity, documentation, and algorithm performance.

🛠 Technical Skills

Languages: Python, R, SQL, Bash
Bioinformatics Tools: Salmon, fastp, MultiQC, BLAST, MEME Suite, ORFfinder, InterProScan
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Biopython
R/Bioconductor: DESeq2, ggplot2 (if applicable)
Software Engineering: Git/GitHub, version control, repo structuring, documentation
Other: Data visualization, experimental design, writing & communication

📂 Repository Structure (for major projects)

I follow a standardized structure for reproducibility:

project/
│── data/               # raw or example data
│── results/            # figures, processed outputs
│── src/                # analysis scripts and modules
│── notebooks/          # exploratory or end-to-end analyses
│── env/                # environment.yml or requirements.txt
│── README.md

🎯 What I’m Working On Now

Completing an end-to-end RNA-seq pipeline (with full figures + documentation)

Refining multi-omics integration workflows for regulatory genomics

Adding a clean template for future bioinformatics repo structure

Building a visual gallery (QC plots, volcano plots, PCA, genome browser screenshots)
