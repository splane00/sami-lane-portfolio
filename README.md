**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, DESeq2, Biopython  
**Bioinformatics:** RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis, differential expression, promoter analysis, protein domain prediction, BLAST, InterPro, SignalP, TMHMM, PSIPRED, GTEx, GEO, ENCODE, UCSC Genome Browser  
**Development & Analysis Tools:** Bash, Git, GitHub, Conda, VS Code, Jupyter, shell scripting  

## Featured Projects

### [Differential Expression Mini-Analysis (Simulated RNA-seq)](https://github.com/splane00/rna-seq-mini)
A fully executable, dependency-light RNA-seq differential expression workflow built on simulated count data to demonstrate core transcriptomics concepts without external data dependencies. Designed as a portfolio-ready demonstration emphasizing reproducibility, clean Python→R integration, and statistical reasoning.

**Key features:**
- Python-based simulation of RNA-seq count data with known differential expression
- R/DESeq2 normalization, variance stabilization, and differential expression testing
- PCA and volcano plot visualizations for exploratory analysis
- One-command execution with automatic dependency setup (macOS/Linux compatible)

**Skills:** Python, R/Bioconductor, DESeq2, data simulation, statistical modeling, PCA, data visualization, reproducible workflows
**Repo:** rna-seq-mini

### [BTN1A1 Multi-Omics Characterization](https://github.com/splane00/bioinfo_projects/blob/main/BTN1A1.pdf)  
A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of BTN1A1 integrating genomics, transcriptomics, protein structure prediction, evolutionary conservation, and regulatory landscape annotation. This project synthesizes public datasets and computational tools to generate a research-grade multi-omics gene profile.

Highlights:
- Annotated BTN1A1 gene structure, isoforms, SNPs, paralogs, and orthologs
- Predicted promoter architecture, transcription factor motifs, and regulatory elements
- Modeled protein domains, Ig-like structures, signal peptide, and transmembrane topology
- Evaluated expression across tissues (GTEx) and in breast cancer (GEO GSE15852)
- Integrated ENCODE histone marks and DNase-seq to assess regulatory activity
- Performed multi-species conservation analysis using BLAST, FASTA, and MSAs

Skills: Genomic annotation, promoter analysis, protein structure prediction (InterPro, TMHMM, SignalP, PSIPRED), BLAST/FASTA, GTEx/GEO/ENCODE interpretation, UCSC Genome Browser, multi-alignment tools, scientific writing
