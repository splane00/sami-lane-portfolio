# Bioinformatics Portfolio
**Samantha Lane**, Graduate student - M.S. in Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University

Welcome! This portfolio highlights projects and skills from my graduate coursework. Each section links to a dedicated repository that demonstrates a core skill area. It is designed to demonstrate practical skills, reproducible workflows, and clear scientific communication for research and industry roles in genomics, epigenetics, and precision medicine.

## Core Skills

- [**Database Navigation**](https://github.com/splane00/database-navigation)  
  Working with NCBI Gene, Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser, and PubMed searches.

  - **Bioinformatics Analysis of BTN1A1 Gene** 
    Conducted database-driven analysis of the BTN1A1 gene using Entrez, Ensembl, NCBI, BLAST, and ENCODE.
    Identified splice variants, SNPs, and orthologs across multiple species.
    Compared protein domains and regulatory regions to assess potential impacts on gene expression and function.
    Produced a structured report with database screenshots, sequence alignments, and visualizations.

- [**Sequence Alignment**](https://github.com/splane00/sequence-alignment)  
  BLAST, pairwise alignments, and multiple sequence alignments (Clustal, MUSCLE).

- [**Phylogenetics**](https://github.com/splane00/phylogenetics)  
  Building and interpreting phylogenetic trees using MEGA, PhyML, and Ensembl Trees.

- [**Protein & Gene Analysis**](https://github.com/splane00/protein-gene-analysis)  
  Protein motifs, domains, and structure prediction with UniProt and Pfam.

- [**Data Analysis**](https://github.com/splane00/data-analysis)  
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and Pandas**
    Performed data wrangling, cleaning, and transformation on tabular datasets.
    Applied EDA techniques to uncover trends and generate summary statistics.
    Built data visualizations in Seaborn and Matplotlib, turning raw data into clear insights.

  - **Data Cleaning in Excel**
    Standardized and organized a messy dataset using Excel formulas and automation techniques.
    Eliminated duplicates, corrected formatting errors, and validated entries.
    Produced a clean dataset suitable for downstream analysis and reporting.

- [**Scientific Communication**](https://github.com/splane00/scientific-communication)  
  Research summaries, critiques, and polished projects.

- [**R/Python for Bioinformatics**](https://github.com/splane00/r-python-bioinformatics)  
  Scripts, notebooks, and utilities for sequence, expression, and visualization tasks.
